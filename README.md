### Problem:
In this project, we aim to build a predictive model to determine whether a hotel booking would be canceled, which is crucial for hotels as cancellations affect revenue and operational planning. The dataset contains a high number of features related to booking, such as lead time, deposit type, and special requests, which adds to the complexity of the model. The challenge lies in the data preprocessing steps, which include feature selection and engineering, handling missing values, and noise in the data. Additionally, we are going to train different models, evaluate their performance using the right metrics, and interpret the model by analyzing the most important features in the context of hotel booking cancellations.

### Objectives:
- Explore the Dataset: Investigate the dataset's basic information, summary statistics for numerical and categorical variables.
- Preprocessing Steps:
  - Select and engineer features
  - Handle missing values
  - Handle noisy data
  - Encode categorical variables
- Model Building:
  - Implement and tune classification models including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
  - Emphasize achieving high F1-score for class 1, ensuring comprehensive identification of booking cancellations
- Evaluate and Compare Model Performance: Utilize accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC to gauge models' effectiveness.
- Analyze Feature Importance: Understand which features have the most influence on the predictions.
